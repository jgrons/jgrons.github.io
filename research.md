I develop statistical and machine learning methods to understand the digital phenotype - the health information that is left behind in the digital data we generate in our everyday lives.  My academic work centers on the analysis of routinely collected clinical data in the form of electronic health records. My work at [Verily](https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/mood2/) focuses on the use of passively collected data from a smartphone to understand mood and behavior.
