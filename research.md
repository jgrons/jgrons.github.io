My research is centered on the development of statistical methods that leverage modern digital data sources,
both clinical and non-clinical, to enhance our understanding of human health and improve healthcare. In the last 
decade, the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has generated massive amounts of routinely
recorded medical data for use in translational research. More recently, the ubiquity of the smartphone has enabled
passive and continuous data collection of health and behavior outside of traditional clinical settings. 

However, data heterogeneity, quality issues, and privacy concerns impose unique analytical challenges to the analysis of
EHR and mobile health data. These challenges have motivated my statistical interests in two primary areas: 
(i) predictive modeling with limited or no outcome information and (ii) meta-analysis in finite samples and under data sharing restrictions.
