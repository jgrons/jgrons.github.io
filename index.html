 I'm a biostatistician working on health data science. <br></br>  
		    	    
Most of my work focuses on the development of machine learning and statistical inference methods for 
routinely collected digital data such as electronic health records and mobile health data.  <br></br>

Currently, I'm a data scientist at Alphabet's <a href="https://verily.com/"> Verily Life Sciences</a>. I will be joining
the Department of Statistical Sciences at the <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/"> University of Toronto</a> 
in July 2020. <br></br>

I received a BA in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/"> UC Berkeley </a>  
and a PhD in  Biostatistics at <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/"> Harvard University </a> under 
the direction of <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/"> Tianxi Cai</a>.  I was also a postdoctoral researcher  
in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html"> Stanford School of Medicine </a> 
with <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/lu-tian"> Lu Tian</a>.
