I am a biostatistician turned health data scientist focusing on machine learning
and statistical inference methods for electronic health records and mobile health data.  <br></br>

Currently, I am a data scientist at Alphabet's <a href="https://verily.com/"> Verily Life Sciences</a>. <br></br>

In July 2020, I will join the Department of Statistical Sciences at the
<a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> as an assistant professor.  I will also be a
faculty affiliate of the <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute</a> for Artificial Intelligence. <br></br>

I received a BA in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/"> UC Berkeley </a>  
and a PhD in  Biostatistics at <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/"> Harvard University </a> under 
the direction of <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/"> Tianxi Cai</a>.  I did my postdoctoral work  
in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html"> Stanford School of Medicine </a> 
with <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/lu-tian"> Lu Tian</a>.
