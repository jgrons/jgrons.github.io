 <p>Welcome! I'm a data scientist at Alphabet's <a href="https://verily.com/"> 
	Verily Life Sciences</a>.  Prior to joining Verily, I received my PhD in  Biostatistics 
	at <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/"> Harvard University </a> under the direction of 
		Professor <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/"> Tianxi Cai</a>.
	I was also a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html"> Stanford School of Medicine </a>
	with Professor <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/lu-tian"> Lu Tian</a>.  </br> </br>

	I am particularly interested in the application of data science to healthcare problems.  Most of my time is
spent developing statistical methods to leverage routinely collected digital data such as
electronic health records and mobile health data. 
	
	</br> </br>
	When I'm not doing statistics, you'll likely find me running, 
	cooking, or walking my dog, Teddy.
