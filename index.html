 <p> Welcome to my site!  I'm a data scientist at Alphabet's <a href="https://verily.com/"> 
	Verily Life Sciences</a>.  Prior to joining Verily, I received a BA in Applied Mathematics at 
	 <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/"> UC Berkeley </a> and a PhD in  Biostatistics 
	at <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/"> Harvard University </a> under the direction of 
		Professor <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/"> Tianxi Cai</a>.
	I was also a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html"> Stanford School of Medicine </a>
	with Professor <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/lu-tian"> Lu Tian</a>.  </br> </br>

	I am interested in the application of data science to healthcare problems. Most of my work
	focuses on the development of statistical methods for routinely collected digital data such as electronic
	health records and mobile health data.
