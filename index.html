I'm a data scientist at Alphabet's [Verily Life Sciences](https://verily.com/).  Prior to joining Verily, I received my 
PhD in  Biostatistics at [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) under the direction of
Professor [Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/). I was also a postdoctoral researcher in the 
Department of Biomedical Data Science at the [Stanford School of Medicine](http://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html) 
with Professor [Lu Tian](https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/lu-tian).

I am particularly interested in the application of data science to healthcare problems.  Most of my time is
spent developing statistical methodology designed to leverage routinely collected digital data such as
electronic health records and smartphone data.  

When I'm not doing statistics, you'll likely find me running, cooking, or walking my energetic dog, Teddy.
