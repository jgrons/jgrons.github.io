I'm a data scientist at Alphabet's [Verily Life Sciences](https://verily.com/).  Prior to joining Verily, I received my PhD in  Biostatistics at [Harvard University] (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) under the direction of Professor [Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/). I was also a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at the [Stanford School of Medicine](http://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html) with Professor [Lu Tian (https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/lu-tian).

I am particularly interested in using statistics and machine learning to solve problems in the clinical domain.  Most of my research focuses on the development of methods for estimation and evaluation of risk prediction models built with modern digital data such as electronic health records and mobile health data.
		
When I'm not doing statistics, you'll likely find me running, cooking, or walking my energetic dog, Teddy.
